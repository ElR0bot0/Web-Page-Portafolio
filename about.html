    <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a final year student, I am in the final stretch of my studies and about to conclude my professional internships, a period during which I have consolidated and expanded my experience in the development of web and mobile applications. Throughout my academic training, I have actively participated in various projects covering both front-end and back-end, culminating in a position as a full-stack developer during my internships.
                <br><br>
                My technical skills are diverse, as I am proficient in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, TypeScript, as well as markup and styling technologies like CSS and HTML. Additionally, I have experience with the Blazor framework, which allows me to create robust and modern web applications.
                <br><br>
                Outside the academic realm, I have found a unique way to combine my passion for video games with a source of income, serving as a professional Game Master at Startplaying.games. This activity not only reflects my interest in gaming but has also honed my skills in time management and team coordination, dealing with the dynamics of varied and demanding groups.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, my fascination with the video game industry has led me to delve into game design and interactive experiences. I have completed a specialized course in video game design and possess solid competence in using Unity, which allows me to explore and create immersive virtual worlds.
                <br><br>
                I am excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional environment, contributing to innovation and success in software development and digital experiences.
