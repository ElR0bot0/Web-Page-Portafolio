# My Portfolio Website

This project is a static webpage that serves as my personal portfolio. It's designed to showcase my skills, achievements, and projects I've worked on.

## How It Works

The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's structured into different sections, each highlighting a different aspect of my portfolio:

- **About Me**: This section provides a brief introduction about myself and my background.
- **Skills**: Here, I list the programming languages, tools, and technologies that I'm proficient in.
- **Achievements**: This section highlights the milestones and accomplishments in my career.
- **Projects**: In this section, I showcase the projects I've worked on. I do this by using the githubAPI to take all of my public repositories and put their names on a list. Each item on a list sends to a page that shows the details of that project. How that works is that it sends the project id as a parameter and it takes the README file of that project and displays it as the page content. Doing that makes it easier on my end to not have to update this page and instead it keeps being updated on its own as I make projects.

I am currently also trying to make a Google drive API work so it does this with google docs. This would be for those projects that I cannot give all of the info out or that are not mine to begin with btu I did collaborate on.

The website is static, meaning it consists of fixed content and doesn't require a backend server to function. It can be hosted on any web server that can serve static files.

## How to Use
https://elr0bot0.github.io/WebPagePortafolio/index.html
To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. To edit the website, open the project files in a text editor and make your changes. The website can be easily customized by editing the HTML files (to change the content) and the CSS files (to change the appearance).
